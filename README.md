Pawnstars - Python API Wrapper for NFL Statistics and Related Subject-matter
=============================================================================

This is an API wrapper for the NFL api, and the NGS (Next Gen Stats) api. It makes use of an undocumented
api endpoint to automatically retrieve and refresh the required OAuth2 token, making it very convenient
for quick, specific searches. The amount of data, and detail contained with the NFLs databases is remarkable.
This is very incomplete, only supports a specific query prototype on the 'games' api endpoint at this time.
